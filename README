This project provides a Linux streaming server for full-resolution Dicom
image data. 

The code has been designed for speed and scalability.

Dependencies:
0) Boost threads
1) libev
2) libeio
3) iconv (this is needed by the Imbera  Dicom library, but will eventually be
  removed once a stripped-down version of Imebra is integrated)
4) Imebra Dicom toolkit: I have forked a version of this excellent toolkit
and put it on Github. It is included as a submodule of DicomStream. So, after
cloning this project, you must call:
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update


Data Flow:

1) accept callback: trigger read
2) read callback:  
   a) parse message
   b) queue file prefetch
   c) create file queue
   c) trigger eio file open on first file
3) open callback: trigger readahead (5 K)
4) readahead callback: 
   a) parse Dicom header on file 
   b) calculate pixel fragment offsets for file
   c) if no more files to read, or this is a multi frame, then create proper iterator
