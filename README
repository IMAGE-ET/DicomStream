This project provides a Linux streaming server for full-resolution Dicom
image data. 

The code has been designed for speed and scalability.

Dependencies:
0) Boost threads
1) libev
2) libeio
3) Imebra Dicom toolkit: I have forked a version of this excellent toolkit
and put it on Github. It is included as a submodule of DicomStream. 


After cloning this project, do the following:

A) set up git submodules

$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update


B) Install boost

C) Install libev

D) Install libeio



ToDo:

- in a branch, trim down Imebra to bare essentials, to avoid code bloat
- implement UID string => UID number code
- increment file refcount when calling open, readahead, prefetch, etc. so that file is not
closed while these operations are in progress
- add prefetch using custom EIO, and fadvise(SEQUENTIAL....)
- fix error handling, check for leaks, decide when to close connection with client
- handle EFIN, etc.
- c# client
- handle message for change of primary index (stacking)
