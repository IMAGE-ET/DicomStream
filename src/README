- blocking queue with list<Iterator<string>>
- iterator can be an SimpleIterator, or a FragmentIterator

- ability to re-prioritize the list:
      - push one iterator to top of list and/or reset primary frame
      
      
B) LIBEIO - FILE READS

modify gdcmStreamImageReader to read from memory buffer
    - handle multi-frame - ask about this on news group
    
D) PROTOCOL

length of message (unsigned int, in network byte order)
serialized protocol buffer


E) CLIENT
